* Problem 2
Since \(\beta \equiv 1/(k_{B}T)\), \(\partial \beta = -
\frac{1}{k_{B}T^{2}}\partial T\).
\begin{align}
c_{v}    & \equiv \frac{\partial <U>}{\partial T} \\
        & =  - \frac{1}{k_{B}T^{2}} \frac{\partial <U>}{\partial \beta} \\
        & =  \frac{1}{k_{B}T^{2}} \frac{\partial }{\partial \beta} (\frac{\partial ln(Z)}{\partial \beta}) \\
        & =  \frac{1}{k_{B}T^{2}} \frac{\partial }{\partial \beta} (\frac{\partial Z /\partial \beta}{Z}) \\
 & = \frac{1}{k_{B}T^{2}} \frac{\frac{\partial^{2}Z}{\partial\beta^{2}} Z - (\frac{\partial Z}{\partial\beta})^{2}}{Z^{2}} \\
 & = \frac{1}{k_{B}T^{2}} (\frac{\frac{\partial^{2}Z}{\partial\beta^{2}}}{Z} - (\frac{\partial Z}{\partial \beta} / Z)^{2}) \\
& = \frac{1}{k_{B}T^{2}} (<U^{2}> - <U>^{2})
\end{align}

For the last step, we used the fact that \(Z = \sum e^{-U\beta}\), taking
derivative with respect to $\beta$ twice will bring down $U^{2}$.

** a
- The global minimum is at \(\frac{\partial V(r_{ij})}{\partial r_{ij}} = 0\).
  Solving this equation we get \(r_{ij} = 4*2^{1/6} \approx 4.4898 \)
- By definition of the force \(F = - \frac{\partial V}{\partial r}\), there
  should be no force at \(r_{m}\)
- When \(r_{ij} = r_{m} + 0.5 \), \(F = - \frac{\partial V}{\partial r} =
  -0.5989510746437929\), it's attractive force, they should pull towards each
  other.
- When \(r_{ij} = r_{m} - 0.5 \), \(F = - \frac{\partial V}{\partial r} =
  6.2953600398067096\), it's repulsive force, they should push them away from
  each other.
** b
The mixing rule says: \(\sigma_{AB} = 1/2 (\sigma_{A} + \sigma_{B}) = 4 \)
angstrom. And, \(\epsilon_{AB} = \sqrt{\epsilon_{A}\epsilon_{B}} \approx 0.98
kJ/mol\)

* Problem 4
** a
- Bond terms: \(4 + 1 = 5\), 4 C-H and 1 C-C.
- Angles: \(4 + 2\), 4 H-C-C, 2 H-C-H
- Dihedrals: \(4\), 4 H-C-C-H
** b
- For a single molecule, there are \(4\) distinct pairs of hydrogen that has 1-4
  interactions.
- For two molecules, there are \(8 + 36\) non-bonded interactions terms. $8$
  from 1-4 interactions, and $36$ from inter-molecular atomic interactions.

* Problem 5
- There are three hydrogens, so the period of the potential is $2\pi/3$.
- The stable states occurs at \(\pi/3,\pi, 5pi/3\) angles, they are *staggered
  conformation*
- The un-stable states occurs at \(0, 2\pi/3, 4\pi/3, 2\pi\) angles, they are
  *eclipsed conformation*.
- I referenced this [[https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/2020/02/28/staggered-vs-eclipsed-conformations-of-ethane/][website]] to answer this question.
