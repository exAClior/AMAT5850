* Problem 1
From statistical mechanics, we know the following rule. When there is a phase
change, some function related to the structure of the system will change
abruptly. More specifically, you could calculate *RMSD* for the system under
investigation. Over time, you should see a discontinuity in the plot of time
versus *RMSD*. That's when a phase change occurred.

A plot may look something like this.

* Problem 2
In a folded protein, I expect to find hydrophobic amino acids in the *innerds*
of the structure. Conversely, I expect to find hydrophilic amino acids on the
*outside* of the folded protein. This is basically due to the need to minimize
energy in the folded state of a protein.

- Hydrophobic Amino Acid: Alanine
- Hydrophilic Amino Acid: Aspartic Acid
- I have illustrated the protein: BARNASE MUTANT WITH ILE 88 REPLACED BY ALA
  (1BRJ). In addition, I illustrated the hydrophobic amino acid, Alanine, as
  balls. I also illustrated the hydrophilic amino acid, Aspartic Acid, as
  surface.
