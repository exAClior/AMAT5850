* Problem 1
** A
\(F(x) = - \frac{\partial U(x)}{\partial x} = -(x-1)\), at $t=0$, $x=0$ so $F= 1$.
** B
According to the velocity Verlet algorithm, we know
\[\vec{x}(t+\delta t) = \vec{x}(t) + \delta t \vec{v}(t) + \frac{1}{2} \delta t^2 \vec{a}(t)\]
and
\[\vec{v}(t + \delta t) = \vec{v}(t) + \frac{1}{2}\delta t [\vec{a}(t) + \vec{a}(t+\delta t)]\]
with \(x(0)  = 0, v(0) = 0, a(0) = F(0)/m = 1\),
\[\vec{x}(\Delta t = 0.5)  = 1/8 \]
then,  \(a(\Delta t = 0.5) = -(1/8-1) = 7/8\)
\[ \vec{v}(\Delta t = 0.5) =  15/32\]
** C
We know \(E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x-1)^2\), for $t = 0$, $E = 0.5$. For $t = 0.5$, $E = 225/2048 + 49/128 = 1009/2048 \approx 0.492675$
** D
It was not conserved. This is because the time-step is not truly infinitesimal,
the updated velocity position are not truly accurate. Therefore, there will be
error in the energy calculated according to those values.

* Problem 3
In partition function, the probability of a state is proportional to
\(e^{KE/k_BT}\). If you want the probability to stay the same, you need
\(KE_{inst}/(k_{B} T_{inst}) = KE_{target}/k_{B}T_{Target}\) therefore,
\(v_{inst}/v_{target} = \sqrt{\frac{T_{inst}}{T_{target}}}\)
